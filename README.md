A basic webpage designed to help learn the basics of html and css

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The webpage will start using only html and then continue to include css once the css content has been covered.

Once completed I will have demonstrated a basic knowledge of html and css with a good knowledge of correct markup etiquette.
