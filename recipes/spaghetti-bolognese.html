  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Everyone needs a great everyday Spaghetti Bolognese recipe, and this is mine! 
    The Bolognese Sauce is rich, thick and has beautiful depth of flavour. 
    It’s perfect for a quick midweek meal though if you have the time to simmer this Meat Sauce for a couple of hours, 
    you’ll take it from seriously delish to OMG this is amazing!!</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> 1/2 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves , minced</li>
    <li>1 onion , finely chopped (brown, yellow or white)</li>
    <li>1 lb / 500g beef mince (ground beef) OR half pork, half beef (Note 1)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup (125 ml) dry red wine (sub water or beef broth/stock)</li>
    <li>2 beef bouillon cubes , crumbled OR granulated beef bouillon (Note 2)</li>
    <li>800g / 28 oz can crushed tomato (or tomato passata)</li>
    <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
    <li>2 tsp white sugar , if needed (Note 3)</li>
    <li>2 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>2 dried bay leaves</li>
    <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme (or 1/2 tsp dried thyme or oregano)</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    <li>400 g / 13 oz spaghetti , dried</li>
    <li>Parmesan cheese and finely chopped parsley (optional)</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Method</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic, cook for 3 minutes or until light golden and softened.</li>
    <li>Turn heat up to high and add beef. Cook, breaking it up as your go, until browned.</li>
    <li>Add red wine. Bring to simmer and cook for 1 minute, scraping the bottom of the pot, until the alcohol smell is gone.</li>
    <li>Add remaining ingredients except salt and pepper. Stir, bring to a simmer then turn down to medium so it bubbles gently. Cook for 20 – 30 minutes (no lid), adding water if the sauce gets too thick for your taste. Stir occasionally.</li>
    <li>Slow simmer option: really takes this to another level, if you have the time! Add 3/4 cup of water, cover with lid and simmer on very low for 2 – 2.5 hours, stirring every 30 minutes or so. (Note 5) Uncover, simmer 20 minutes to thicken sauce. (Note 6 for slow cooker)</li>
    <li>Adjust salt and pepper to taste right at the end. Serve over spaghetti – though if you have the time, I recommend tossing the sauce and pasta per steps below.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Tossing sauce and spaghetti</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add pasta and cook per packet directions MINUS 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Scoop out a mug of pasta cooking water and set aside, then drain the pasta.</li>
    <li>Add pasta into the bolognese sauce with about 1/2 cup (125 ml) of reserved pasta water over medium heat. Toss gently for 1 1/2 – 2 minutes, or until the spaghetti turns red and the sauce thickens.</li>
    <li>Divide between bowls. Garnish with parmesan and parsley if desired.</li>
  </ol>
