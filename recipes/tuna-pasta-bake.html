      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>tbsp olive oil</li> 
        <li>2 garlic cloves , minced</li>
        <li>1 small onion , finely diced</li>
        <li>800g / 28 oz crushed tomato</li>
        <li>1 tbsp tomato paste (optional, thickens sauce slightly)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (185ml) water (Note 2)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Italian mixed herbs , or other dried herbs of choice</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>425g / 15 oz can chunk tuna (preferably in oil), drained (Note 3)</li>
        <li>200g / 7 oz spiral pasta (or other pasta of choice)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (150g) shredded mozzarella cheese (Note 4)</li>
        <li>Olive Oil , for drizzling</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Method</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 180C/350F.</li>
        <li>Cook pasta per packet directions, minus 1 minute. Drain, rinse under tap water to stop it sticking together, set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the sauce. Heat an ovenproof skillet over medium high heat. Add garlic and onion, cook for 3 minutes until golden.</li>
        <li>Add tomato, water, herbs, salt and pepper and tomato paste if using. Stir, bring to simmer, lower heat to medium and simmer energetically for 5 minutes (stir every now and then) until it thickens.</li>
        <li>Adjust salt to taste. Also add a touch of sugar if it tastes a bit sour (depends on quality of tomato).</li>
        <li>Turn the stove off, add pasta, stir in.</li>
        <li>Add tuna and GENTLY stir it in - don't break up the tuna so it disintegrates into mush. Leave some chunks on the surface (nice when it is golden).</li>
        <li>Drizzle with oil, top with cheese then bake for 20 minutes until golden and you get those nice crusty bits you see in the photos.</li>
        <li>Stand for 3 minutes then serve!</li>
      </ol>
